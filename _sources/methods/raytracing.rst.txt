Ray Tracing Introduction
========================


Ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path
of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its
encounters with virtual objects. The technique is capable of producing a high
degree of visual realism, usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering
methods, but at a greater computational cost. Ray tracing is used in
applications where image quality is critical, such as in visual effects for
movies and in architectural visualizations
