MOAB File Format
================


The file format for :term:`MOAB` meshes comes from the file specification for
:term:`DAGMC` meshes. These files are in the native `.h5m` format, which is an
HDF5 file containing the mesh itself along with associated metadata. In lieu of reproducing
the entire specification here, we refer the reader to the `DAGMC file specification`_.


Instructions for building :term:`DAGMC` using Cubit can be found here: `OpenMC preparation instructions`_.
