    `Coreform Cubit <https://coreform.com/products/coreform-cubit/>`_
        A commercial software package for mesh generation, geometry
        simplification, and mesh-based simulations.

    `Cubit <https://cubit.sandia.gov/>`_
        A Sandia National Laboratory software package for mesh generation, geometry
        simplification, and mesh-based simulations.

    `DAGMC <https://svalinn.github.io/DAGMC/index.html>`_
        Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo toolkit

    FEA
        Finite Element Analysis

    `MOAB <https://sigma.mcs.anl.gov/moab-library/>`_
        Mesh-Oriented datABase

    `OpenMC <https://docs.openmc.org>`_
        An open-source Monte Carlo code for neutron and photon transport.

    EntitySet
        An arbitrary collection of entities in MOAB, including other
        `EntitySet`'s. Parent-child relationships between `EntitySet`'s can also
        be established. Synonymous with the term :term:`MeshSet`.

    MeshSet
        A collection of entities in MOAB. Synonymous with :term:`EntitySet`.

    Tag
        A named data field that can be associated with entities in MOAB. Each
        tag has an immutable data type. The size of the data can be fixed or
        variable.

    `GPRT <https://github.com/gprt-org/GPRT>`_
        General Purpose Raytracing Toolkit

    XDG
        Accelerated Discretized Geometry

    subdomain
        A region of a mesh that is bounded by surfaces. In the context of XDG,
        a subdomain is a region of a mesh that is bounded by surfaces that are
        treated as interfaces between different materials. Also refferred to as
        a mesh block.

    `libMesh <https://libmesh.github.io/>`_
        A C++ finite element library that provides a framework for the
        development of parallel adaptive finite element methods.
